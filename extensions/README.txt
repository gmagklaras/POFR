In this directory, we install files/utilities from third parties:

-IP2LOCATION-LITE GeoIP2 databases
-scponly source and binary RPM package for running POFR on the RHEL/Alma/Rocky 9 variants. 
-The getsshfailedattempts.pl is not a core tool of POFR but is here to help admins/devops handle SSH brute force attacks and cross reference data from the OS journal with data collected from the relational layer.
