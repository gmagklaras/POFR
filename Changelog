v1.2.0 named "Hedy Lamarr" (Oct 1 2022):
- Bug fixes:
  - mergetables.pl: Improved the data date range sampling loop (speed and accuracy) of the architables subroutine, by ordering the fields with the ORDER BY
    statement. psentity is NOT unique in the psinfo table. (info fed from MERGE tables), so it can never be used to sort out tables. The same in ordering 
    the fields before we extract them to the CSV file. (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/701e67a816cc2971be2c08f5c7968bef944aa9d2)
  - POFR.pm: Corrections on the fact we were not returning array references from the get_requested_data_from_time_range subroutine and that was creating 
    problems when we wanted to call the function. Fixed now. (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/c853cef81d73e671dc0a038d887fa49e843683e2)
- Security issues:
  - All security bugs addressed in the Perl Delta for release 5.36.0 Delta. (https://perldoc.perl.org/5.36.0/perldelta) (see also 
    Improvements/upgrades/compatibility issues) 
- Impovements/upgrades/compatibility issues:
  - sendproc.pl: Increased the persistence of the client on failed connections from 3 min to 4 min. (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/9f46f0862407a34e772832a1a5de07671e4ac32b)
  - producepofrperl: Added the DateTime::Format::Duration CPAN module, necessary for date conversions. (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/1eb31cbd78de9863193f53971522c2729d0ee82f)
  - Added the utility scripts:
     findrange.pl: A collection of routines to create subsets of the archived data. Not yet in use in production, only for testing:

v1.1.0 named "Lorinda Cherry" (Feb 27 2022):
- Bug fixes: 
  - mergetables.pl: Removed a loop where we waiting from thread 1 for the other threads to finish to call mergetables.pl. Mergetables.pl is called at the beginnig of the
    processing cycle. (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/aa7691f4fd6169571fa832e6cfef04c6cbbddb32)
  - pofrclientunregister.pl: Fixed issue with the script erroneously checking for server user registration directories by removing left over sanity check code from the 
    server part. (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/8a8233d61d66939e0a0bef204302df6783e157be)
- Security issues:
  - pofrsreg.pl: Possible security issue: Remove the display from status messages of the variable. Not safe and not necessary. 
    (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/86306a72de8438bea213d96da8a54b791a58c171
- Impovements/upgrades/compatibility issues:
  - Added the utility scripts:
    pofrclientderegister.pl (client side: https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/b560ca51d1841a386a055715e464538df0611f64)
    pofrcleanreg.pl (server side: https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/a24c6e0f8dfce99760b38f31bec3460b335437bc)
    to automate/aid the deregistration of systems from the POFR solution
  - Various improvements of the POFR Technical Operations and User Manual (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/69d422288f78ad2d9ac7106892ece60620dfa340)
  - pofrsreg.pl: Improved/refactored the STATUS, Warning and Error messages. (pofrsreg.pl: Improved/refactored the STATUS, Warning and Error messages.)
  - pofrperlrhelcentos8x86_64.tar.gz: Added a POFR Perl release 5.34.0 for the RHEL/ALMA/Rocky/CentOS 8 ecosystem.
    (https://github.com/gmagklaras/POFR/commit/75cbce1b26c4ede08ba55277ec21a89835427a53)
  - LHLT.sql: Added a client hostname field. However, this creates incompatibility of the 'lhlt.lhltable' table with previous versions/releases.
    To avoid re-registering clients on the server side and constructing the table from scratch, the easiest thing to do is to:
    -a)Wait for all POFR server threads to finish processing.
    -b)Connect to the POFR server MariaDB as administrator as described in section E of the POFR Technical Operations and User Manual and issue the following:
     use lhlt;
     ALTER TABLE lhltable ADD hostname varchar(130) NOT NULL AFTER lastip;
     These commands should allow you to alter the table on the fly. You can then continue processing data with currently registered systems with no issues.
    
v1.0.0 named "Nicole-Reine Lepaute" (Feb 05 2022):
- Bug fixes: Race errors halting execution of parse cycles when calling the mergetables.pl and mergearchives.pl scripts are now fixed.
- Feature implementation: GeoIP2 locating IPv4 and IPV6 destination IP addresses has been implemented by incorporating the IP2Location Lite databases. 
- Rebase of PERL to the latest stable version 5.34.0
