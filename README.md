<b><h2>Penguin OS Flight Recorder</h2></b>

![GitHub Logo](/POFR.png)<br>

The Penguin OS Flight Recorder collects process execution, file access and network/socket endpoint data from the Linux Operating System. Its main purpose is to <b><u>reliably reproduce from each of the monitored Linux clients </u></b>:
<br>
-Event sequence for all OS level events on thethat concern process execution, file access and network endpoint creation. <br>
-Computer account involvement and/or misbehaving apps <br>
-Post mortem evidence after security compromises <br>

All events are logged in a relational (RDBMS) layer to aid event correlation in incident response and devops operations <br>
